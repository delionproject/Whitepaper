# Abstract
<p>
	Delion Project is a blockchain project started in 2019, this year we are a 3 year olds blockchain project. This long existence proves our commitment to make this project more successful and bigger. Our vision when we started the project was to provide an investment ecosystem that focus on masternode and staking. Align we that vision, we now have 2 products / platforms; <a href="https://masternodes.biz" target="_blank">Masternodes.biz</a> and <a href="https://dex.delion.online" target="_blank">Deliondex</a>
	<br />
	The purpose is investors can do research of masternode coins, create masternode with only 1 click on Masternodes.biz and buy the coins on Deliondex. It's a place for everything masternode.
	<br />
	However, in this last 3 years we faced a lot of obstacles to deliver what we had in mind, especially with Deliondex. Deliondex were created to bridge Indonesian investors into Masternode world where until now there is no Indonesian exchange that want to support masternode coins. Therefore, Delion Project has made many changes and we are targeting the Delion Project to become one of the big players in the world of cryptocurrency investment.
	<br />
	In 2022 we are focused on maximizing profits across all of our business lines and increasing the economic value of Delion Coin especially against Delion Masternodes apart from volatile market prices.

# Vision and Mission
1. Become an ecosystem focused on <b>generating profits</b>.
2. Adds economic value and privileges to Delion Masternode owners across all Businesses run by the Delion Project.
3. Expanding through Masternodes.biz and Deliondex

# The Problems
Blockchain technology has developed rapidly, became very popular and was adopted by the wider community. However, it is precisely because of its increasing popularity that it creates new problems which will be described below
## 1. Strict regulation on Centralized Exchange (CEX)
Centralized Exchange (CEX) is getting more and more pressured by the regulations and rules set by many governments in the countries where the Exchange is located.
<br />
The regulation has a good purpose; to prevent fraud and money laundering. Therefore, the regulator requires exchange operators to collect customer personal data or what is known as "Know Your Customer (KYC)". But on the other hand, this is contrary to the basic principles of blockchain technology itself, namely <b>Decentralized</b> and <b>Anonymous</b>.
## 2. High network costs on Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
Blockchain-based exchanges or so-called Decentralized Exchange (DEX) have been around for a long time to answer the problems that exist in the Centralized Exchange, but another problem arises; there are blockchain fees which are quite expensive in conducting transactions on DEX. As an example; The gas fees on the Ethereum network is very expensive, and on other blockchains there are still fees that make it difficult for new investors and traders to do many transactions on the DEX.
## 3. Specific issues that occur with Deliondex
So far Deliondex has been running well and safely on the Bitshares network. Bitshares technology is very sophisticated and up-to-date for crypto-based financial transactions, but even though the blockchain costs are inexpensive on the Bitshares network, it becomes a barrier for us to increase transaction volume, because after all we need lots of BTS coins for big deals. The more BTS you need, the more costs you have to pay to buy BTS coins.

# The Solution
Deliondex must find a blockchain of the same type as Bitshares in order to grow and get out of the main problem that has hindered Deliondex's development so far. With the creation of <b>ALTEChain</b> which is basically a duplicate of Bitshares technology with the modification of removing network fees can be a perfect solution for Deliondex.
<br /><br />
Apart from that Deliondex functions like a DEX so we will not collect user data or KYC. With this, Deliondex can run in a decentralized and anonymous manner.
<br /><br />
For that we chose to move Deliondex from Bitshares network to Altechain's sidechain called <b>ALTEChain</b>.

## Development Plan
### 1. Deliondex
With no network fee we are free to do the following:
- List as many assets as we want including the popular tokens and stable coins.

- Increase liquidity and arbitrage trading for DLN pairs.
- Multiple asset listing paths; voting using DLN coins, payment of asset registration fees with DLN coins, free registration with marketing plans involving DLN coins.

- Furthermore Deliondex can be an investment platform by offering <b>Farming</b> for <b>stable coins</b>.

# Conclusion

<br /><br />
Meanwhile, for Masternodes.biz, we will add new features that have not been available on the largest masternode platform, namely MNO. Masternodes.biz does not strive to be the greatest, but strives to be the best and most comprehensive.

All of these developments involve features that give DLN masternode owners special rights in the Delion Project ecosystem.
